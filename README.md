# To-Do-List

This project is my first experience using Node and Express in a real application and connecting it to a frontend. It is also my first experience using Tailwind. I'm working through the project slowly to develop a deeper understanding of all of these new tools. I'm also working on using Git in the command line and writing better commit and pull request messages.
